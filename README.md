PyCaret 3.0 

A Python-based, open-source library for low-code machine learning PyCaret is a Python library that offers low-code solutions for machine learning, streamlining the process by automating workflows. It serves as a comprehensive tool for machine learning and model management, significantly accelerating the experimental cycle and enhancing productivity. In comparison to other open-source machine learning libraries, PyCaret stands out as a low-code alternative that can condense hundreds of lines of code into just a few, making experiments remarkably quick and efficient. Essentially, PyCaret acts as a Python interface for several machine learning libraries and frameworks, including but not limited to scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, spaCy, Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray. The architecture and user-friendliness of PyCaret are influenced by the rising prominence of citizen data scientists, a concept initially introduced by Gartner. These citizen data scientists are power users capable of executing both basic and moderately complex analytical tasks that would have previously necessitated more technical skills.
